# Database URL where to save data (currently supported are SQLite and Postgres).
# We suggest sqlite for small to medium data sizes or enough system RAM (as a rule of
# thumb: less than a million segments, and/or more than 8GB of RAM) and postgres
# otherwise (note that with postgres, the database must have been created beforehand).
# If sqlite, just write the path to your local file prefixed with 'sqlite:///' (e.g.,
# 'sqlite:////home/myfolder/db.sqlite'): non-absolute paths will be relative to the
# config file path.
# If non-sqlite, the syntax is: dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database
# E.g.: postgresql://smith:Hw_6,@mymachine.example.org/mydb
# (for info see: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls)

# =======

# The event catalog in form of URL (event web service) or local file path.
# The events list returned by the URL or in the supplied file must be formatted as
# specified in https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=16
# or in isf format (http://www.isc.ac.uk/standards/isf/download/isf.pdf), although the
# latter has limited support in this program (e.g., comments are not recognized. Use at
# your own risk).
# IMPORTANT: when providing a file, the file name (not the full path) will be used as
# catalog identifier: renaming the file and downloading again on the same database will
# result in the events and their segments being saved twice, most likely unnecessarily.
# Implementation details: you can also type these shortcut strings instead of URLs:
# {{ DOWNLOAD_EVENTWS_LIST }}.

# ====================
# Stations / Channels: https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=10
# ====================

# Limit the search to the specified channels (if missing, defaults to '*', i.e. fetch all
# channels). For info see https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf.
# You can also filter out specific channels by placing the special character "!" in front
# of them. This is a non standard FDSN syntax implemented in this program only, and thus
# will be applied after the list of channels is obtained. Consequently, pay attention to
# inconsistencies such as "!B*,BBB" that will first fetch all channels "BBB" and then
# remove ("!") all channels starting with "B" ("B*"), causing no channel to be selected.
# Implementation details: You can also specify a YAML sequence of strings instead of
# comma-separated strings. E.g., these are equivalent:
# channels: "A,B"
# cha: [ "A" , "B" ]
# channel:
#  - "A"
#  - "B"
channel:
 - "HH?"
 - 'HN?'
 - 'HL?'
 
# Limit the search to the specified networks (see 'channel' parameter for details)
network: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified stations (see 'channel' parameter for details)
station: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified locations (see 'channel' parameter for details)
location: '*'

# Limit the search to channels with at least the following sample rate (in Hz).
# The relative segments will most likely (but not always) match the channel sample rate.
# Set to 0 or negative number to ignore the sampling rate
min_sample_rate: 60


# Update segments metadata, i.e., overwrite the data of already saved stations and
# channels, such as e.g., the channels sample rate, or the station inventories (see also
# ‘inventory’ parameter). On a subsequent download, you can also provide "only" as value
# (without quotes) to update metadata only, skipping events and waveform download: in
# this case the only parameters used will be 'dataws' (to get the station web service(s))
# and 'inventory' (to optionally re-download and save all station inventories).
update_metadata: false

# Download station inventories (xml format). Already saved inventories will be
# overwritten according to ‘update_metadata’
# Implementation details: inventories will in any case be downloaded and saved on the
# database only for stations that have saved segments with waveform data
inventory: true

# search radius: defines the criteria for selecting stations around events. It is a dict
# which can have either:
# 1) two arguments ('min', 'max'), to select stations within 'min' and 'max' deggrees
# (endpoints included) from each event location (type min=0 for a circular search area)
# 2) four arguments, to select stations within a circular area whose radius is dependent
# on the event magnitude:
#
#                   |
#     maxmag_radius +                oooooooooooo
#                   |              o
#                   |            o
#                   |          o
#     minmag_radius + oooooooo
#                   |
#                   ---------+-------+------------
#                         minmag   maxmag
# If minmag = maxmag = M, `maxmag_radius` will be used for events with magnitude >= M,
# `minmag_radius` otherwise
search_radius:
 minmag: 6 # min magnitude
 maxmag: 7 # max magnitude

# ========================
# Data (waveform segments) https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=8
# ========================

# List of URLs for downloading waveform data (data web services). All URLs must be
# FDSN-compliant (e.g.: https://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query). You can also
# type two special values: 1) "iris" (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology),
# shortcut for the URL above or 2) "eida", shortcut for several nodes - or data centers -
# of the European Integrated Data Archive. Being FDSN compliant, all URLs are also used
# to fetch automatically the stations and channels necessary for the waveforms download.
# This means that when providing several URLs, station conflicts (e.g., the same station
# code returned by more than one URL) might happen. The program tries to resolve
# conflicts with a Routing service (for EIDA URLs) or by checking if the station URL is
# saved on the database from a previous download. HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE that unresolved
# conflicts - albeit rare - will cause the station to be discarded (the user will be
# notified in the log file) and all its available waveforms not to be downloaded
# Implementation details: If no station /channel could be downloaded (e.g., connection
# problems), then the requested stations and channels will be fetched from the database,
# if non-empty (otherwise the download process will stop with an error message). The EIDA
# routing service is configurable in `advanced_settings`
dataws:
  - 'eida'
  # - 'iris'

# The model to asses the travel time of a wave from the event location to a station
# location, which will be used to get the segment arrival time (travel time +
# event time) and eventually the segment time window to download (see also `timespan`).
# Type one of the 4 built-in models:
#   ak135_ttp+: ak135 model for all ttp+ phases (P wave arrivals)
#   ak135_tts+: ak135 model for all tts+ phases (S wave arrivals)
#   iasp91_ttp+: iasp91 model for all ttp+ phases (P wave arrivals)
#   iasp91_tts+: iasp91 model for all tts+ phases (S wave arrivals)
# Implementation details: the models above are grids of pre-computed travel times
# obtained from the corresponding model. The grids allow to speed up significantly the
# computation introducing a negligible interpolation error (roughly in the order of
# few milliseconds and never exceeding 0.5s). Disclaimer: you can also create your own
# grid file and put its path here. However, the procedure is not maintained anymore, use
# at your risk. For info type `python stream2segment/traveltimes/ttcreator.py --help`
traveltimes_model: 'ak135_ttp+'

# The segment's time span (i.e., the data time window to download): specify two positive
# floats denoting the minutes to account for before and after the calculated arrival
# time. Note that 3.5 means 3 minutes 30 seconds, and that each segment window will be
# eventually rounded to the nearest second.
# Implementation details: the rounding is necessary to avoid floating point errors when
# checking for segments to re-download because of a changed window.
timespan:
 - 1.0 # start of the waveform segment, in minutes *before* the calculated arrival time.
 - 3.0 # end of the waveform segment, in minutes *after* the calculated arrival time

# Credentials to download restricted data. When null, missing or "", only open waveforms
# will be downloaded. When provided, it can be either a list of two strings (username and
# password), or, for EIDA node(s), a string denoting the path of a token file (to get a
# token, see https://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/waveform/archive/auth/auth-overview.php)
# IMPORTANT: You SHOULD NOT perform massive, time-consuming downloads when fetching
# restricted data: first, it makes no sense: credentials are valid only for the
# organization emitting them (thus there must be only one item in `dataws`) and second,
# credentials might have an expiration time (e.g., roughly few hours for EIDA tokens).
# Thus, try narrowing the search: e.g., shorter time bounds, network(s) or station(s) of
# interest only. Have a look also at `max_concurrent_downloads` in `advanced_settings` as
# in this case you might want to improve download efficiency over execution speed.
# Implementation details: restricted segments previously downloaded with no credentials
# (thus, with no waveform data) will be always re-downloaded ignoring all 'retry'
# settings. If you need to provide username and password, remember indentation in YAML
# (see parameter `timespan`). If you provide a token with a non-absolute path, its path
# will be relative to the config file path
restricted_data: ""

# Retry already downloaded segments if the database reports that the previous attempt was

 # The drawback is that some waveform data might not be downloaded because servers
 # usually limit the number of concurrent requests allowed from the same source. This

 # to lower this parameter (e.g., 1, 2) to increase download efficiency over speed, e.g.:
 # a) when fetching restricted data (see `restricted_data` parameter)
