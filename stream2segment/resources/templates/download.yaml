# Database URL where to save downloaded data, either SQLite (local file db) or Postgres
# (local or remote db. With postgres, the database must have been created beforehand). We
# suggest sqlite for small to medium data or enough system RAM (as a rule of thumb:
# less than a million segments, and/or more than 8GB of RAM) and postgres otherwise.
# For info see: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls
dburl: 'sqlite:///<local_file_path>'  # or, e.g.: postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<dbname>

# Download events (and data) on or after the specified time. Type an ISO-formatted
# date, date-time string, or an integer in days, where 0 is the start of the current day.
# E.g., start=-1 and end=0 means: fetch events occurred yesterday
starttime: 2006-01-01T00:00:00

# Download events (and data) on or before the specified time. Type an ISO-formatted
# date, date-time string, or an integer in days, where 0 is the start of the current day.
# E.g., start=-1 and end=0 means: fetch events occurred yesterday

# =======
# Events: https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=14
# =======

# The event catalog in form of FDSN URL or local file path.
# The events list, returned by the URL or in the supplied file, must be in FDSN format
# (https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=16) or ISF format
# (http://www.isc.ac.uk/standards/isf/download/isf.pdf), although ISF has limited support
# (e.g. comments are not recognized and should be removed): use it at your own risk.
# IMPORTANT: when downloading on an existing database, the program identifies already
# downloaded events comparing their id and catalog URL. If the catalog is a file, the
# file name will be used instead: as such, pay attention to rename an events file, or you
# might end up re-downloading all events and data unnecessarily.
# You can also type these shortcut strings instead of URLs:
# {{ DOWNLOAD_EVENTWS_LIST }}.

# ====================
# Stations / Channels: https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=10
# ====================

# NOTE: the station URL(s) are configurable in `data_url` (see below). When
# providing several URLs, if the same station code is returned by more than one URL, the
# program will try to infer the correct one by means of a Routing service for EIDA URLs
# (see `advanced_settings`) or by querying the station URL to the database, if any. If
# none of the operations is successful, the station will be discarded and all its
# available waveforms not downloaded (see log file in case).
# Implementation details: in case of connection problems where no station can be fetched,
# then the requested stations (and channels) will be fetched from the database, if any.

# Limit the search to the specified channels (if missing, defaults to '*', i.e. fetch all
# channels). For info see https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf.
# You can also filter out specific channels by placing the special character "!" in front
# of them. This is a non standard FDSN syntax implemented in this program only, and thus
# will be applied after the list of channels is obtained. Consequently, pay attention to
# inconsistencies such as "!B*,BHZ" that will first fetch all channels "BHZ" and then
# remove ("!") all channels starting with "B" ("B*"), causing no channel to be selected.
# Implementation details: You can also specify a YAML sequence of strings instead of
# comma-separated strings. E.g., these are equivalent:
# channels: "A,B"
# cha: [ "A" , "B" ]
# channel:
#  - "A"
#  - "B"
channel:
 - "HH?"
 - 'HN?'
 - 'HL?'
 
# Limit the search to the specified networks (see 'channel' parameter for details)
network: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified stations (see 'channel' parameter for details)
station: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified locations (see 'channel' parameter for details)
location: '*'

# Limit the search to channels with at least the following sample rate (in Hz).
# The relative segments will most likely (but not always) match the channel sample rate.
# Set to 0 or negative number to ignore the sampling rate
min_sample_rate: 60

# Update segments metadata, i.e., overwrite the data of already saved stations and
# channels, such as e.g., the channels sample rate, or the station inventories (see also
# ‘inventory’ parameter)
update_metadata: false

# Download station inventories (xml format). Already saved inventories will be
# overwritten according to ‘update_metadata’
# Implementation details: inventories will in any case be downloaded and saved on the
# database only for stations that have saved segments with waveform data
inventory: true

# search radius: defines the criteria for selecting stations around events. It is a dict
# which can have either:
# 1) two arguments ('min', 'max'), to select stations within 'min' and 'max' deggrees
# (endpoints included) from each event location (type min=0 for a circular search area)
# 2) four arguments, to select stations within a circular area whose radius is dependent
# on the event magnitude:
#
#                   |
#     maxmag_radius +                oooooooooooo
#                   |              o
#                   |            o
#                   |          o
#     minmag_radius + oooooooo
#                   |
#                   ---------+-------+------------
#                         minmag   maxmag
# If minmag = maxmag = M, `maxmag_radius` will be used for events with magnitude >= M,
# `minmag_radius` otherwise
search_radius:
 minmag: 6 # min magnitude
 maxmag: 7 # max magnitude
 minmag_radius: 3 # search radius for min mag (deg)
 maxmag_radius: 3 # search radius for max mag (deg)
 # min: 0  # min radius (deg)
 # max: 3  # max radius (deg)


# ========================
# Data (waveform segments) https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=8
# ========================

# List of URLs for downloading waveform data segments. All URLs must be
# FDSN-compliant (e.g.: https://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query). You can also
# type two special values: 1) "iris" (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology),
# shortcut for the URL above or 2) "eida", shortcut for several nodes - or data centers -
# of the European Integrated Data Archive. Being FDSN compliant, all URLs are also used
# to fetch automatically the necessary metadata (stations and channels)
data_url:
  - 'eida'
  # - 'iris'

# The segment's time window to download: specify two floats denoting the start and end
# time, in minutes relative to the calculated arrival time (negative numbers are usually
# input for start). Note that 3.5 means 3 minutes 30 seconds, and each segment window
# will be eventually rounded to the nearest second.
# Implementation detail: segments already on the database whose window does not match
# the requested window will be re-downloaded and overwritten
time_window:
 - -1.0
 - 3.0


# Credentials to download restricted data. When null, missing or "", only open waveforms
# will be downloaded. When provided, it can be either a list of two strings (username and
# password), or, for EIDA node(s), a string denoting the path of a token file (to get a
# token, see https://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/waveform/archive/auth/auth-overview.php)
# IMPORTANT: credentials are valid only for the organization emitting them and often have
# an expiration time (e.g., few hours for EIDA tokens). As such, it is advisable NOT to
# perform massive downloads when fetching restricted data: target only the relative
# data URL and - if available - the specific network, station or time period of interest
# (for advanced users: see also `max_concurrent_downloads` in `advanced_settings`).
# Implementation details: restricted segments previously downloaded with no credentials
# (thus, with no waveform data) will be always re-downloaded ignoring all 'retry'
# settings
restricted_data: ""

# Retry already downloaded segments if the database reports that the previous attempt was
# unsuccessful because no data could be found. This typically happens when a single
# request of several waveform segments to a server gets in response only some of them,
# with no clue about the missing ones, which are then "marked" as "not found"
retry_seg_not_found: true

# Retry already downloaded segments if the database reports that the previous attempt was
# unsuccessful because of a general URL error (e.g., no internet connection, timeout, ...)
retry_url_err: true

# Retry already downloaded segments if the database reports that the previous attempt was
# unsuccessful because the waveform data was malformed, i.e. is not readable as MiniSeed
retry_mseed_err: false

# Retry already downloaded segments if the database reports that the previous attempt was
# unsuccessful because of a client (i.e., stream2segment) request error
retry_client_err: true

# Retry already downloaded segments if the database reports that the previous attempt was
# unsuccessful because of a server (see `data_url`) response error
retry_server_err: true

# Retry already downloaded segments if the database reports that the previous attempt was
# unsuccessful because the received data was completely outside the requested time window
retry_timespan_err: true

advanced_settings:
 # Maximum number of concurrent downloads allowed. We recommend to leave this parameter
 # to null (let the program infer the number automatically) and set it to 1 (max 2) only
 # in case you need to maximize download efficiency over speed, e.g.:
 # a) when fetching restricted data (see `restricted_data` parameter)
 # b) when retrying to fetch data from a specific datacenter which reported many download
 #    errors suggesting to "slow down", e.g. "Service Unavailable" (code 503) or

 # The model to assess the travel time of a wave from the event to a station, which will
 # be used to get the segments arrival time (travel time + event time) and eventually the

 #   iasp91_ttp+: iasp91 model for all ttp+ phases (P wave arrivals)
 #   iasp91_tts+: iasp91 model for all tts+ phases (S wave arrivals)
 # Implementation details: the models above are grids of pre-computed travel times
 # obtained from the corresponding model. The grids allow to speed up significantly the
 # computation introducing a negligible interpolation error (roughly in the order of
 # few milliseconds and never exceeding 0.5s)
