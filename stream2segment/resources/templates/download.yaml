# Database url where to save data (currently supported are sqlite and postgresql).
# We suggest sqlite for small to medium data sizes or enough system RAM (as a rule of thumb:
# less than a million segments, or more than 8GB of RAM) and postgres
# otherwise (note that with postgres, the database must have been created beforehand).
# If sqlite, just write the path to your local file
# prefixed with 'sqlite:///' (e.g., 'sqlite:////home/myfolder/db.sqlite'): non-absolute
# paths will be relative to the config file path.
# If non-sqlite, the syntax is:
# dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database
# E.g.: 'postgresql://smith:Hw_6,@mymachine.example.org/mydb'
# (for info see: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls)
dburl: 'sqlite:///./db.sqlite'

# =======
# Events: https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf#page=14
# =======

# The event web service url to use. Supply a *full* url (up to and not including
# the first query character '?') or a path to a local file.
# The events list returned by the url or in the supplied file must be formatted as specified
# in https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf#page=16
# or as isf (http://www.isc.ac.uk/standards/isf/download/isf.pdf), although the latter
# has limited support in this program (e.g., comments are not supported. Use at your own risk).
# Implementation details: 1. You can also type one of the following shortcut strings:
# {{ DOWNLOAD_EVENTWS_LIST }}.
# 2. If providing an event list file, the file name (not the full path) will be used
# as catalog identifier: renaming the file and downloading again on the same database
# will result in the events and their segments being saved twice

# ====================
# Stations / Channels: https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf#page=10
# ====================

# Limit the search to the specified channels (if missing, defaults to '*', i.e.: accept all channels)
# Wildcards '?' and '*' are recognized (https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf),
# as well as the operator '!' placed as first character to indicate logical NOT.
# Example: "!B*,BBB" accepts all channels NOT starting with "B" OR the channel "BBB"
# Implementation details: 'cha' or 'channels' are also valid names for the parameter. You can
# also specify a list/array of strings in yaml format instead of comma-separated strings.
# E.g., these are equivalent:
# channels: "A,B"
# cha: [ "A" , "B" ]
# channel:
#  - "A"
#  - "B"
channel:
 - "HH?"
 - 'HN?'
 - 'HL?'
 
# Limit the search to the specified networks (see 'channel' parameter for details).
# Implementation details: 'net' or 'networks' are also valid names for the parameter.
network: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified stations (see 'channel' parameter for details).
# Implementation details: 'sta' or 'stations' are also valid names for the parameter.
station: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified locations (see 'channel' parameter for details).
# Implementation details: 'loc' or 'locations' are also valid names for the parameter.
location: '*'

# Limit the search to channels with at least the following sample rate (in Hz).
# The relative segments will *most likely* (but not always) match the channel sample rate.
# Set to 0 or negative number to ignore the sampling rate
min_sample_rate: 60

# Update segments metadata, i.e. when fetching stations and channels, save them
# to the database overwriting already saved stations and channels, if present.
# When false, only new stations and channels will be saved to the database.
# On a subsequent download, you can also provide "only" as value (without quotes)
# to update metadata only, skipping events and waveform download: in this case the *only*
# parameters used will be 'dataws' (to get the station web service(s)) and 'inventory'
# (to optionally re-download and save all station inventories).
update_metadata: false

# Download station inventories (xml format). When true, you can
# control whether or not to overwrite already saved inventories with 'update_metadata'
# (when false, update_metadata should also be false for data consistency).
# Implementation details: inventories will in any case be downloaded and saved on the database
# only for stations that have saved segments with data. 
inventory: true

# search radius: defines the criteria for selecting stations around events. It is a dict
# which can have either:
# 1) two arguments ('min', 'max') in order to select stations exactly or within 'min' and 'mag' degrees
# from each event location (min=0 is equivalent to a circular search area)
# 2) four arguments in order to select stations within a circular
# area whose radius is event's magnitude dependent:
#
#                   |
#     maxmag_radius +                oooooooooooo
#                   |              o
#                   |            o
#                   |          o
#     minmag_radius + oooooooo
#                   |
#                   ---------+-------+------------
#                         minmag   maxmag
# If minmag = maxmag = M, maxmag_radius will be used for events with magnitude >= M,
# minmag_radius otherwise
search_radius:
 minmag: 6 # min magnitude
 maxmag: 7 # max magnitude
 minmag_radius: 3 # search radius for min mag (deg)
 maxmag_radius: 3 # search radius for max mag (deg)
 # min: 0  # min radius (deg)
 # max: 3  # max radius (deg)


# ========================
# Data (waveform segments) https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf#page=8
# ========================

# Dataselect web service(s) to use (list of URLs). Each URL *must* be FDSN
# compliant, so that the station web service URL can be retrieved automatically:
# [site]/fdsnws/dataselect/[majorversion]/query. Example:
# https://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query
# (If the URL scheme - basically the prefix "http://" or "https://" - is missing,
# 'http://' will be prepended to the URL. An ending '/' or '?' will be removed
# from the URL, if present). You can also type two special values:
# "iris" (shortcut for: https://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query) or
# "eida" (which will automatically fetch data from the urls of all EIDA data centers).
# Implementation details: If the station web service(s) did not return data
# (e.g., connection problems), then the requested stations and channels will be fetched from the
# database. In this case, if the database is empty the download process will stop with an error
# message. If the same station/channel is returned by more than one station web
# service, the eida routing service (see `advanced_settings`) will be used. If the
# latter cannot resolve conflicts (e.g., non-eida station/channel), then the
# station/channel will be discarded and the warning message logged for inspection.
dataws:
  - 'eida'
  # - 'iris'

# The model to be used to asses the travel times of a wave from
# the event location to each station location. Type a string denoting a file name (absolute path)
# of a custom model created by means of `s2s utils ttcreate` or one of the 4 built-in models:
#   ak135_ttp+: ak135 model precomputed for all ttp+ phases (P wave arrivals)
#   ak135_tts+: ak135 model precomputed for all tts+ phases (S wave arrivals)
#   iasp91_ttp+: iasp91 model precomputed for all ttp+ phases (P wave arrivals)
#   iasp91_tts+: iasp91 model precomputed for all tts+ phases (S wave arrivals)
# For each segment, the arrival time (travel time + event time) will be the pivot
# whereby the user sets up the download time window (see also 'timespan').
# Implementation details: the *max* error on the arrival times (assessed on a random set of points)
# using one of the precomputed models is in the order of 0.5 seconds. All builtin models
# assume receiver depth=0 for simplicity
traveltimes_model: 'ak135_ttp+'

# The segment's time span (i.e., the data time window to download): specify two positive floats denoting 
# the minutes to account for before and after the calculated arrival time. Note that 3.5 means
# 3 minutes 30 seconds, and that each segment window will be eventually rounded to the nearest
# second.
# Implementation details: the rounding is necessary to avoid floating point errors when checking
# for segments to re-download because of a changed window.
timespan:
 - 1.0 # start time of the waveform segment to download, in minutes *before* the calculated arrival time.
 - 3.0 # end time of the waveform segment to download, in minutes *after* the calculated arrival time

# Set the credentials in order to download restricted data.
# IMPORTANT: You SHOULD NOT perform massive, time-consuming downloads when fetching restricted data,
# as the credentials validity might expire during the download execution (this is the case with EDIA tokens).
# Try narrowing the search in case (e.g. provide the network(s) or station(s) of interest only).
# Also note that restricted data downloads work with only one URL in `dataws`
# This parameter can be:
# - a single string pointing to a token file for restricted data authorization if "dataws" is "eida") 
#   (https://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/waveform/archive/auth/auth-overview.php). Non-absolute
#   paths will be relative to the config file they are written in.
# - a list of two strings denoting username and password
# when this parameter is null, or the empty string, only open (unrestricted) waveform data will
# be downloaded. When provided, restricted segments previously downloaded with no credentials
# (thus, with no waveform data) will be always re-downloaded ignoring all 'retry' settings.
restricted_data: ""

# Try to download again already saved segments with no waveform data because not found
# in the response. This is NOT the case when the server returns no data with an appropriate
# 'No Content' message, but when a successful multi-segment request returns some but not all
# requested segments: missing segments will then belong to the "not found" category
retry_seg_not_found: true

# Try to download again already saved segments with no waveform data because of a
# general url error (e.g., no internet connection, timeout, ...)
retry_url_err: true

# (response code in [400,499])
retry_client_err: true

# Try to download again already saved segments with no waveform data because of a server error
